             <p class="lng-vahagni-history-p-1">
                Vahagnի village is a quite old village. According to historians, it has a history of 3500 years. There were 2 neighbor villages in the previous territory of the settlement: Verin Vahagn և Nerkin Vahagni (in honor of the Armenian God of courage Vahagn, the villagers called those areas Hagni). In the 17th century, the Persians settled in Nerkin Vahagni and named the village Shahali. In 1802 the village was relocated with 7 families who migrated from Western Armenia, Karabakh and Ijevan. 1947 the settlement was renamed Vahagni. In 1807, the church of the village, Surb Nshan, was built. Because of the devastating earthquake of 1988 destroyed the church's roof and there are only still standing the walls of the church and the bell tower. In the center of the village, on the hill, stands the monument to Vahagn's glory. The monument to Vahagn the Dragon was erected in honor of the people of Vahagni who died in the Great Patriotic War.

                    It is not a secret, that the Armenian monasteries and churches have played a great role in the spiritual and cultural life of the Armenian people. It is also not a secret that in Armenia, outside of the churches, there are many churches, monasteries and chapels in the country without state care, which alos have cultural value. Like all the churches in Armenia, this one is not an exception. Among such churches is S. Nshan church of Vahagni village of Lori region. Before the construction of Nshan Church, the village was not considered a settlement, as there was no spirit center in the village. In 1806-1807 the church of Vahagni (Shahali) was built by seven families of the village. The elders of the families gathered together and sent a delegation consisting of several people to the Catholicos. The Catholicos announces to the priest of Gharakilisa to provide the settlement with clergy so that a village can be formed. The sign provided the caring life of the community. The bell tower was built later in 1836. The church was built by one person during one year (1807) as a repentance.

                    The bell tower of the church was built as a result of an argument between a sister and a brother. According to the tradition, Sargis blamed his nephews for his burnt grass, but in the end it turns out that they were not guilty. The only way to get rid of guilt was to build a church bell tower. Sarkis thought that it was a dishonest money, as a repentance, he built the Belfry (1836). St. Nshan Church functioned until the establishment of the Soviet Order until 1922. Then it turned into a collective farm warehouse. The roof finally collapsed in 1988 due to a devastating earthquake. The church is now destroyed, only the church walls and the bell tower are standing. Over time, due to the lack of renovation of the church, the walls of the church became more damaged due to rain, dampness and moisture. Now the church is in a deplorable state. The village does not have a care center at the moment, the villagers are comforted by the only khachkar, which is considered a place of pilgrimage and an environment of unification. If the state is not able to stand on its own two feet, then we, the young people, are obliged to at least restore what we have in exchange for what we have lost, with the prospect of not losing it or desecrating it. On this occasion, we had interviews with people who are ready to support this initiative within their competence. Aramayis Sahakyan, a graduate student at the Georgian Seminary in Etchmiadzin, says that he has visited the village of Vahagni several times and prayed in the church together with the village youth and schoolchildren. to become a communicator of values. Every church is an expression of faith. ”

                        Vahagni A. The director of the secondary school after Kochinyan, Andranik Kochinyan, says. 'The Armenian Apostolic Church has a very important role for each community. History has shown that the church has played a great role in the defense of the nation. Unfortunately, at this moment St. Nshan Church is bowed, we can not visit the church on holidays, we go to Vanadzor to participate in church holidays. Through the Armenian Apostolic Church we will be able to prevent the spread and substantiation of sects in the community. While studying sects, I realized that they mainly undermine the foundations of the state. The renovation of the church will have a positive impact on the cultural and caring development of the community.'Grandpa Vigen, a resident of the village, tells. 'I still remember how a liturgy was served in the church, at that time the church was a strong link for the development of culture and caring life. I still play the role of the church for our village'.The village considers it a big family, and the church - the house, if the church is destroyed, it can be considered that the family is also divided.'Until now, the church bells ring in my ears, it would be good if the church bells rang in the community during the church holidays,' says Pope Vigen.Another resident of the community says that if someone is found to help with the renovation of the church, the whole village is ready to help.Suren Vardumyan, one of the active young people of the village, did a great job for the renovation of the church.He set up a fund to raise money for the renovation of the church, as there was an architect who was ready. to the case. That student was Garnik Vardumyan, a resident of Vahagni villageHe went to war among the 445 people of Vahagn and fought for every inch of land with unreserved devotion.
